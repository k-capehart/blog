I'm a Sr. Software Engineer who specializes in Salesforce implementations. 

I started my career at Siemens, where I was first introduced to the SFDC platform as an intern. Once I earned my bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science from the University of Central Florida, I took my knowledge to Deloitte where I acted as a Developer/Consultant for the Federal Government. My journey then took me to American Tire Distributors, where I remain today as a Senior Software Engineer.

Beyond Salesforce, I like to learn other tech stacks, and have done some scripting in Python and Go, and even some front-end work in Angular.
