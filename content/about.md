I'm a Software Engineer based in Orlando, Florida who specializes in Salesforce implementations. I hold the Platform Developer II certification and earned my Computer Science degree at the University of Central Florida. I love to learn and am improving my skills in Python, Go, and Angular.

At my current role I serve as a Senior Software Engineer at American Tire Distributors, where I work on various systems related to customer interaction. Previously, I worked as a Developer at Deloitte, giving me a wide breadth of experience in a client facing role. I have acted as a leader throughout my career and always strive to nourish growth within my team.

It has always been my goal to apply engineering best practices to the Salesforce platform. While Salesforce is my specialty, I am happiest when I am solving novel problems of any sort. This blog aims to document my solutions.

Beyond work, I can usually be found reading a book or playing video games. I also love to run and participate in local races. Ask me about my cat Brisket.
