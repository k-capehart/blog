I'm a Software Engineer who specializes in Salesforce implementations.

At Deloitte, I was a Salesforce Consultant before I moved on to my current role as Sr. Software Engineer at American Tire Distributors. I lead the Salesforce implementation among other responsibilities. I love to learn, and am trying to improve my skills in Python, Go, and Angular.

Beyond work, I like to run, read fiction, and play video games on my PC. Ask me about my cat Brisket.
