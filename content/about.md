<br/>

I'm a Software Engineer based in Orlando, Florida. I hold multiple developer certifications and earned my Computer Science degree at the University of Central Florida. I have done extensive work with the Salesforce platform, but I am always seeking out new challenges to face.

At American Tire Distributors, I led the Customer Engagement team through implementing various solutions to automate sales processes. This includes an automated onboarding system that syncs customer data between Salesforce and a Postgres database hosted in GCP. I also worked on a multi-million e-commerce platform built in SAP Hybris, where I worked on both the front-end and back-end to streamline processes and improve performance. 

Previously, I worked as a Software Developer at Deloitte, building a time-reporting system for the Food and Drug Administration. This time-reporting application is utilized by tens of thousands of FDA employees and is essential to reporting government spending to congress. I was promoted to a leadership role, where I oversaw multiple releases across the various divisions of the FDA, and worked with product owners to ensure solutions were developed with a security-first mindset.

I have acted as a leader throughout my career and always strive to nourish growth within my team. I am happiest when I am solving challenging problems, regardless of the technologies at play. This site aims to document my solutions and showcase work that I am proud of.

Beyond work, I can usually be found reading a book, playing video games, or running. Ask me about my cat Brisket.
