I earned my Computer Science degree at the University of Central Florida. At Deloitte, I was a Consultant before I moved to my current role as Sr. Software Engineer at American Tire Distributors. I lead the Salesforce implementation and work on various systems related to customer interaction. I love to learn, and am trying to improve my skills in Python, Go, and Angular.\nBeyond work, I usually have a book in hand, and read lots of science-fiction and fantasy. I also love to run and participate in local 5K races.
