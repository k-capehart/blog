Flows are the declarative solution to automation in Salesforce. Flows are getting better with every release and are just as powerful as Apex. Flows offer a low barrier to entry. Flows are so simple a child could make them. Flows solved world hunger.\nIn most trainings, Flows are recommended as the go-to solution, with Apex as a secondary option if the logic becomes too complex. This is not a good pattern to design a system with. Apex should almost always be chosen over declarative solutions.\nFirst, let’s get some things out of the way, because there are use cases for Flows. If there isn’t a developer on hand, then code might not be the way to go. This could also be the case with a legacy system with developers that don’t have enough bandwidth to convert everything from Flows. However, given a sales organization that’s making the move to adopt Salesforce then it\u0026rsquo;s important to keep in mind that Salesforce offers a lot of out-of-the-box tools, but it needs to be able to scale. To provide the smoothest transition, Salesforce needs to be viewed as a complex system from the start and designed as such by engineers. Otherwise, the organization is being setup for failure.\nThe Reasoning #When it comes down to it, engineers need to be allowed to engineer. This means using the best tools on hand, and Apex provides this. Let’s break down the reasoning.\nHandling Complex Logic #A small sales organization will probably not need much customization in Salesforce right away. However, as time goes on and the organization grows, complexity compounds. Suddenly Salesforce needs to communicate with numerous systems, process large batches of records, and perform complex SOQL queries.\nFlows are often touted as easier to build, which is certainly true if you’re not a developer, but otherwise not so. Valuable time can be wasted during a sprint trying to get a flow to handle a complex operation (such as processing many child records when a parent is updated), only to eventually give up and move the processing to an invocable Apex action. This extra development time can be avoided if the solution is designed in Apex from the beginning.\nMaintenance #If complex processes are built out in flows then it quickly becomes difficult to maintain. Flows might end up looking like this:\n[image of large flow]\nIt might become necessary to split out functionality from flows into apex triggers instead. Now, automations are handled in two different places and the order of execution needs to be considered to ensure expected outcomes still hold. It’s also very tedious to recreate elements into another flow if logic needs to be shifted around or split out into sub flows. With Apex, code can be easily designed to be reusable without significant extra development time.\nTracking Changes #Version control is essential for any engineering team, Salesforce teams included. Flows have a versioning system, but it’s far from enough. Luckily, flow metadata can be checked into a git repository and tracked from there.\nWhat’s the problem then?\nThe metadata is in xml, and not human readable. The only viable way to review a Flow is to open it in the sandbox it was created in and trace through it. This isn’t feasible if it was developed in a scratch org, meaning the reviewer will have to do their best to read the xml. The problem is even worse if non-Salesforce developers are reviewing the change. A Java developer should be able to trace through Apex without much issue, but stick a Flow in front of them and it might take some time to parse through the purpose.\nWriting Tests #Flows offer almost the same power as Apex but with a simpler learning curve, which is usually considered a positive. There’s a huge problem with this reasoning though. Apex code requires a minimum threshold of code coverage before deploying to production. Flows by default, do not.\nIf anyone can automate business logic, make external callouts to systems, reassign records, expose data, and any number of high impact operations, there needs to be a certain level of secuirity. Not to mention the reliability of a system that doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a set of standardized tests in place. Declarative flow tests [link to release notes] have recently been released to the public, but they don’t replace the full functionalities of Apex test classes. Namely, the ability to set up complex sets of test data and compare related records.\nThere is a way to enforce flow test coverage, which is something any organization with any number of complex flows should utilize. [link to documentation on flow test coverage] However, the fact that it’s not enabled by default is a big concern. If a developer is available to write unit tests in Apex at the start of the development process, then there’s no reason not to have written the business logic in apex as well. A developer can easily break code up into testable units and mock database calls within apex, things that are more cumbersome in a flow.\nConclusion #","date":"12 March 2024","permalink":"/posts/apex-over-flows/","section":"Posts","summary":"Programmatic vs declarative solutions, and why programmatic always wins.","title":"Why you should always use Apex instead of Flows"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts"},{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m a Software Engineer based in Orlando, Florida who specializes in Salesforce implementations.
